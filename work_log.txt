# Project: Minesweeper

## MVP

Recreate a simplified version of the game Minesweeper to be played in the java console
The game should be able to randomly generate 10 mines in a 10x10 grid
The user will be able to enter a command that represents a coordinate to check a location for a mine
The application will display a number from 0-8 depending on how many mines surround that location
If the user selects a mine, the game will respond "boom!" and the game will be lost
If every non-mine square has been revealed, the game is won
Render the grid to the console after every user command

## Bonuses (optional)

Allow for the user to configure number of mines and grid size via a configuration.json file
(Difficult) Discovering an empty square should reveal all squares around it, and cascade into other nearby empty squares

this should be easy, we will use a multi d array for the grid!

lets start by initializing the array then writing a function to display it correctly in the console!

--Mine Grid 
10x10 array of [3d]
d1 = dist from mine 
d2 = already clicked?
d3 = mine? //might be able to remove, just have d1 = 0 be mine

user inputs can be handles with a scanner, have user enter a grid address
this will nessesitate another grid to be displayed to user showing grid adresseses

investigating using a grid (new grid) instead of array 
useing an array of objects now 
final d of arrays will be object containing int (dist from mine) char (character to display)
bool (isClicked) bool (is mine)

decided to keep char in object to reduce logic needed to print minefield

todo add display for just chars

add way to input minefield adress (scanner obviously).

deadline is friday 16th

need to figure out maths for calculating distance from mine.

decided to name method to print adresses as printMineGridAdresses though long i think it's 
important to maintain similar naming conventions for readability.

i've decided to store grid adresses in cell obj as well, this will reduce logic, 

made method to print adresses and main grid, once i finish mvp i'll see about printing the
grids next to each other some how. 

according to google a 10x10 grid of minesweeper should have 10 or 11 mines (9x9 has 10) 

going to call scanner player turn, cant think of a better name

made new class, GameLogic, will put playerTurn() and initializeMines() here.
also need to loop for opportunity to use inheritance, obstract and interface
might not have an oportunity with a project like this but will probably be a good look to 
show oop knowledge

need to access grid from my GaameLogic file, i was thinking an abstract classwhere grid could be declared but then I decided 
it would add unnessesary complexity to my code, if more behaviors are shared will definitly use abstract classes/interfaces.

cant directly cast int to char for my purpose, I have discovered that casting an int to char 
+ '0' will give me the desired result!!
