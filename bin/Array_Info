Array Info
[10][10][2]
Array legend: [column][cell][properties]
the main array/grid has 10 rows, 10 cells per row and 2 boxes to put things into per cell
box 1 (index0) = squares away from bomb with zero representing an actual bomb
box 2 = already clicked = will need to be zero or one, will make check function to automatically set number to 0 if it exceeds 
1 somehow
box 3 = actual char to display on screen, if not clicked all will be an asterix or unicode square //disregard gonna be in 
cell obj

I considered whether to make a new 10x10 char array for box three, however after researching the benefits of objects, and
being assured that for a limited project like this the extra memory and performance expense will be extremely negligable
I have decided to convert my MineGrid into an object. it is important i think that box three not be in a seperate array due to it 
being so closely associated with the array. 

actually scrap that, completly unneccessary i think i'd need to make a cell class, while this would be good OOP it would be 
much, actually scrap scrapping that, my code would be unreadable lol!
going to make cell class
