# Java Minesweeper Project

this is a Java minesweeper cli.
it includes all the basic functionality of a minesweeper game including:

- The game randomly generates 10 mines in a 10x10 grid
- The user is able to enter a command that represents a coordinate to check a location for a mine
- The application will display a number from 0-8 depending on how many mines surround that location
- If the user selects a mine, the game will respond "boom!" and the game will be lost
- If every non-mine square is revealed, the game is won
- Renders the grid to the console after every user command
